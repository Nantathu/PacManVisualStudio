# PacManVisualStudio
Pacman made in C++ for a school project. Not finished yet but I'm working on it.

Project won't be finished in anytime soon since I'm working on wxWidget version of this project.

# How to run
To run the code you will need Visual Studio 2019. Then run the PacManVisualStudio.vcxproj file.
